# Dynamite Paramedics: The Ultimate Rescue Mission!

your mission is simple: get the paramedics to the patient—while dodging, defusing, and desperately trying to "avoid" blowing up everything in sight.

Think you’ve got what it takes to save the day without turning it into a fireworks display? Good luck! With every step you take, you’re also making a new friend in the “Oh-no-I-didn’t-mean-to-detonate-that” club. Just remember: the only thing more explosive than the dynamite is your sense of humor as you navigate the rubble!

Just click on whatever you can find to get the ambulance to the flag.


The goal of the game is to get the ambulance to the goal, flag zone.

You have a tower of destructable blocks with physics that you blow up with dynamite.

You select obsticals to destry and your success / failure depends the order and location from which you destroy the obsitcals.
